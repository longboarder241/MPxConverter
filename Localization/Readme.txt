
Transating MPxConverter:

You can use the English.ini file as a model. To spare time make sure you check
on the program's webpage if the program wasn't already translated.

Saving format:
- INI file, ANSI encoding
- <br> can be used as a line break 
- File must have the English demonym of the language and the real name inside so
  all the files can be detected correctly (because at the moment unicode isn't supported)

For example: test1<br>test2 will show:

test1
test2

on the interface instead of test1test2

Please send the file in an archive at support@bytessence.com and it will be added
in the package (or on the website until a new version is released).

Thank you!
